            <p>I took a trip to <a href="https://www.mjewelry.com/" target="_blank">Meierotto Jewelers</a> with my girlfriend in KC after looking at watches on Reddit for a long time. I was fully intending to, 1. Not buy anything. 2. Just see another cool watch in person that I liked the pictures of. The other watch I liked the<a href="https://www.tudorwatch.com/en/watches/pelagos/m25600tn-0001" target="_blank">Tudor Pelagos</a> did nothing for me and I was thinking maybe this whole hobby is dumb. Then I tried on the Seamaster. The watch that James Bond has been wearing ever since Pierce Brosnan started playing him. 
               The dial made cool wave patterns with the light. You can see some of this affect here

What's nice is that it was about 4 grand at the time and I had just quit my job so I used the opportunity to practice meditation and reducing my in the moment cravings for things I might want someday but would like to just be a nice bonus when the timing is right.

            <p>A devastatingly pretty watch with a bright blue background for the feature that tracks the moon. And very pretty moon art. If I ever win the lottery I will eventually get one of these. And tell myself it's an investment because they appreciate in value. They're also handmade and the story is if you take your watch to the factory in Germany they can tell the indivdual who made it because of their "signature" on the movement of the watch. You'll learn what that is later if you don't know.</p>

            <p>This watch makes me want to be a worse person. Every time I look at it I'm like, could I actually be the <em>villian</em> in a Bond movie, instead of James? Driving a black Jaguar and speaking with a vaguely European accent? When I look at this I think maybe... Then I look at the back of the watch which shows of the aforementiond "movment" and think yes absolutely I could, and will. And am. This is essentially the engine that makes mechanical watches tick, aka work. Much like a car engine they don't need to be pretty, but, at a certain level of luxury and insanity, detailed artists spend hundreds of hours polishing and decorating the movement to make insane rich people feel justified in their purchasing habits.</p>

               <p>So this was the first watch on the moon. It was worn by Buzz Aldrin. He used it to time the return of the lunar lander because his other time keeping device failed. This might be the most important historical watch around and it gives watch enthusiasts warm fuzzies that their hobby is kind of cool in some ways and has some cool history behind it. Also it looks cool, which is the main reason I want it.</p>

            <p>The golf guy, "my daddy has money" generic end all be all annoying watch for people who don't know about watches yes but.... that's only for the new ones. The vintage models look more like they did when Sean Connery was rocking them when he was Bond. These have no real history like the Speedmaster does, might result in you getting robbed because the name is so recognizable, and most people who know about watches will assume it's a fake anyway. So high risk, no reward, and they are ludicrously expensive to buy and to maintain but... They look pretty cool. So I want one. That's the theme of this story.</p>
